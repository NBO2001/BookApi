No  neighbor  had  seen  him  strolling  along  the  sidewalk.  He  simplyappeared, as if stepping between one shadow and the next.</NBO>"

Her twinsister, Taryn, napped on the couch, curled around a blanket, thumb in herfruit-punch-stained mouth.

And on the other end of the sofa, their older sister,Vivienne, stared at the television screen, her eerie, split-pupiled gaze fixed onthe cartoon mouse as it ran from the cartoon cat. She laughed when it seemedas if the mouse was about to get eaten.</NBO>"
                +" Vivi was different from other big sisters, but since seven-year-old Jude and Taryn were identical, with the same shaggy brown hair and heart-shaped faces, they were different, too. Vivi’s eyes and the lightly furred points of her ears were, to Jude, not so much more strange than being the mirror version of another person. </NBO> And if sometimes she noticed the way the neighborhood kids avoided Vivi or the way their parents talked about her in low, worried voices, Jude didn’t think it was anything important. Grown-ups were always worried, always whispering.</NBO> Taryn yawned and stretched, pressing her cheek against Vivi’s knee.</NBO> Outside, the sun was shining, scorching the asphalt of driveways. Lawn mower engines whirred, and children splashed in backyard pools. Dad was in the outbuilding, where he had a forge. Mom was in the kitchen cooking hamburgers. Everything was boring. Everything was fine.</NBO> When the knock came, Jude hopped up to answer it. She hoped it might be one of the girls from across the street, wanting to play video games or inviting her for an after-dinner swim. </NBO>  The tall man stood on their mat, glaring down at her. He wore a brown leather duster despite the heat. His shoes were shod with silver, and they rang hollowly as he stepped over the threshold. Jude looked up into his shadowed face and shivered. </NBO>  “Mom,” he yelled. “Mooooooooom. Someone’s here.”</NBO> Her mother came from the kitchen, wiping wet hands on her jeans. When she saw the man, she went pale. “Go to your room,” she told Jude in a scary voice.“Now!”</NBO> “Whose child is that?” the man asked, pointing at her. His voice was oddly accented. “Yours? His?” </NBO> “No one’s.” Mom didn’t even look in Jude’s direction. “She’s no one’s child.” </NBO> That wasn’t right. Jude and Taryn looked just like their dad. Everyone said so. She took a few steps toward the stairs but didn’t want to be alone inher room. Vivi, Jude thought. Vivi will know who the tall man is. Vivi will know what to do.</NBO> But Jude couldn’t seem to make herself move any farther. </NBO> “I’ve seen many impossible things,” the man said. “I have seen the acorn before the oak. I have seen the spark before the flame. But never have I seen such as this: A dead woman living. A child born from nothing.”</NBO> Mom seemed at a loss for words. Her body was vibrating with tension. Jude wanted to take her hand and squeeze it, but she didn’t dare. </NBO> “I doubted Balekin when he told me I’d find you here,” said the man, his voice softening. “The bones of an earthly woman and her unborn child in the burned remains of my estate were convincing. Do you know what it is to return from battle to find your wife dead, your only heir with her? To find your life reduced to ash?”</NBO> Mom shook her head, not as if she was answering him, but as though she was trying to shake off the words.</NBO> He took a step toward her, and she took a step back. There was something wrong with the tall man’s leg. He moved stiffly, as though it hurt him. The light was different in the entry hall, and Jude could see the odd green tint of his skin and the way his lower teeth seemed too large for his mouth.</NBO> She was able to see that his eyes were like Vivi’s.</NBO> “I was never going to be happy with you,” Mom told him. “Your worldisn’t for people like me.”</NBO> The tall man regarded her for a long moment. “You made vows,” he said finally.</NBO> She lifted her chin. “And then I renounced them.”</NBO> His gaze went to Jude, and his expression hardened. “What is a promise from a mortal wife worth? I suppose I have my answer.”</NBO> Mom turned. At her mother’s look, Jude dashed into the living room.</NBO> Taryn was still sleeping. The television was still on. Vivienne looked up with half-lidded cat eyes. “Who’s at the door?” she asked. “I heard arguing.”</NBO> “A scary man,” Jude told her, out of breath even though she’d barely run at all. Her heart was pounding. “We’re supposed to go upstairs.”</NBO> She didn’t care that Mom had told onlyher to go upstairs. She wasn’t going by herself. With a sigh, Vivi unfolded from the couch and shook Taryn awake. Drowsily, Jude’s twin followed them into the hallway.</NBO> As they started toward the carpet-covered steps, Jude saw her father come in from the back garden. He held an axe in his hand—forged to be a near replica of one he’d studied in a museum in Iceland. It wasn’t weird to see Dad with an axe. He and his friends were into old weapons and would spend lots of time talking about “material  culture” and sketching ideas for fantastical blades. What was odd was the way he held the weapon, as if he was going to—</NBO> Her father swung the axe toward the tall man.</NBO> He had never raised a hand to discipline Jude or her sisters, even when they got into big trouble. He wouldn’t hurt anyone. He just wouldn’t.</NBO> And yet. And yet.</NBO> The axe went past the tall man, biting into the wood trim of the door.</NBO> Taryn made an odd, high keening noise and slapped her palms over her mouth.</NBO> The tall man drew a curved blade from beneath his leather coat. Asword, like from a storybook. Dad was trying to pull the axe free from the doorframe when the man plunged the sword into Dad’s stomach, pushing it upward. There was a sound, like sticks snapping, and an animal cry. Dad fell to the vestibule carpet, the one Mom always yelled about when they tracked mud on it.</NBO> The rug that was turning red.</NBO> Mom  screamed.  Jude  screamed.  Taryn  and  Vivi  screamed.  Everyone seemed to be screaming, except the tall man.</NBO> “Come here,” he said, looking directly at Vivi.</NBO> “Y-you monster,” their mother shouted, moving toward the kitchen. “He’s dead!”</NBO> “Do not run from me,” the man told her. “Not after what you’ve done. If you run again, I swear I—”</NBO> But she did run. She was almost around the corner when his blade struck her in the back. She crumpled to the linoleum, falling arms knocking magnets off the fridge.</NBO> The smell of fresh blood was heavy in the air, like wet, hot metal. Like those scrubbing pads Mom used to clean the frying pan when stuff was really stuck on.</NBO> Jude ran at the man, slamming her fists against his chest, kicking at his legs. She wasn’t even scared. She wasn’t sure she felt anything at all.</NBO> The man paid Jude no mind. For a long moment, he just stood there, as though he couldn’t quite believe what he’d done. As though he wished he could take back the last five minutes. Then he sank to one knee and caught hold of Jude’s shoulders. He pinned her arms to her sides so she couldn’t hit him anymore, but he wasn’t even looking at her.</NBO> His gaze was on Vivienne.</NBO> “You were stolen from me,” he told her. “I have come to take you to your true  home,  in  Elfhame  beneath  the  hill.  There,  you  will  be  rich  beyond measure. There, you will be with your own kind.”</NBO> “No,” Vivi told him in her somber little voice. “I’m never going anywhere with you.”</NBO>"
                +" “I’m your father,” he told her, his voice harsh, rising like the crack of a lash. “You are my heir and my blood, and you will obey me in this as in all things.”</NBO>"
                +" She didn’t move, but her jaw set.</NBO>"
                +" “You’re not her father,” Jude shouted at the man. Even though he and Vivi had the same eyes, she wouldn’t let herself believe it.</NBO>"
                +" His  grip  tightened  on  her  shoulders,  and  she  made a little squeezed, squeaking sound, but she stared up defiantly. She’d won plenty of staring contests.</NBO>"
                +" He looked away first, turning to watch Taryn, on her knees, shaking Mom while she sobbed, as though she was trying to wake her up. Mom didn’t move. Mom and Dad were dead. They were never going to move again.</NBO>"
                +"“I hate you,” Vivi proclaimed to the tall man with a viciousness that Jude was glad of. “I will always hate you. I vow it.”</NBO>"
                +" The man’s stony expression didn’t change. “Nonetheless, you will come with me. Ready these little humans. Pack light. We ride before dark.”</NBO>"
                +" Vivienne’s chin came up. “Leave them alone. If you have to, take me, but not them.”</NBO>"
                +"He stared at Vivi, and then he snorted. “You’d protect your sisters from me, would you? Tell me, then, where would you have them go?”</NBO>"
                +" Vivi didn’t answer. They had no grandparents, no living family at all. At east, none they knew.</NBO>"
                +"He looked at Jude again, released her shoulders, and rose to his feet. “They are the progeny of my wife and, thus, my responsibility. I may be cruel, a monster, and a murderer, but I do not shirk my responsibilities. Nor should you shirk yours as the eldest.”</NBO>"
                +"Years  later,  when  Jude  told  herself  the  story  of  what  happened,  she couldn’t recall the part where they packed. Shock seemed to have erased that hour entirely. Somehow Vivi must have found bags, must have put in their favorite picture books and their most beloved toys, along with photographs and pajamas and coats and shirts.</NBO> "
                +" Or maybe Jude had packed for herself. She was never sure.</NBO> She  couldn’t  imagine  how  they’d  done  it,  with  their  parents’  bodies cooling downstairs. She couldn’t imagine how it had felt, and as the years went by, she couldn’t make herself feel it again. The horror of the murders dulled with time. Her memories of the day blurred.</NBO> A black horse was nibbling the grass of the lawn when they went outside.</NBO> Its eyes were big and soft. Jude wanted to throw her arms around its neck and press her wet face into its silky mane. Before she could, the tall man swung her and then Taryn across the saddle, handling them like baggage rather than children. He put Vivi up behind him.</NBO> “Hold on,” he said.</NBO> Jude and her sisters wept the whole way to Faerieland.</NBO>",

        synopsis: "Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. Though she's now been granted the powers and lifespan of the High Fae, she is haunted by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she performed to save the lives of Tamlin and his people. </NBO>As her marriage to Tamlin approaches, Feyre's hollowness and nightmares consume her. She finds herself split into two different people: one who upholds her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court, and one who lives out her life in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While Feyre navigates a dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms. She might just be the key to stopping it, but only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future-and the future of a world in turmoil. </NBO>  Bestselling author Sarah J. Maas's masterful storytelling brings this second book in her dazzling, sexy, action-packed series to new heights.",

                +"Moonlight leaked into the massive marble bathing room, providing the only illumination as I was quietly, thoroughly sick.</NBO>"
                +"Tamlin hadn’t stirred as I’d jolted awake. And when I hadn’t been able to tell  the  darkness  of  my  chamber  from  the  endless  night  of  Amarantha’s dungeons, when the cold sweat coating me felt like the blood of those faeries, I’d hurtled for the bathing room.</NBO>"
                +"I’d been here for fifteen minutes now, waiting for the retching to subside, for the lingering tremors to spread apart and fade, like ripples in a pool.</NBO>"

                +"I focused on my breathing—in through my nose, out through my mouth. Over and over.</NBO>"
                +"When it seemed like I was done heaving, I eased from the toilet—but didn’t go far. Just to the adjacent wall, near the cracked window, where I could see the night sky, where the breeze could caress my sticky face. I leaned my head against the wall, flattening my hands against the chill marble floor. Real. </NBO>"
                +"This was real. I had survived; I’d made it out.</NBO>"
                +"Unless it was a dream—just a fever-dream in Amarantha’s dungeons, and I’d awaken back in that cell, and— </NBO>"
                +"I curled my knees to my chest. Real. Real.</NBO>"
                +"I mouthed the words.</NBO>"
                +"I kept mouthing them until I could loosen my grip on my legs and lift my head. Pain splintered through my hands— </NBO>"
                +"I’d  somehow  curled  them  into  fists  so  tight  my  nails  were  close  to puncturing my skin. </NBO>"
                +"Immortal strength—more a curse than a gift. I’d dented and folded every piece  of  silverware  I’d  touched  for  three  days  upon  returning  here,  had tripped  over  my  longer,  faster  legs  so  often  that  Alis  had  removed  any irreplaceable  valuables  from  my  rooms  (she’d  been  particularly  grumpy about me knocking over a table with an eight-hundred-year-old vase), and had shattered not one, not two, but five glass doors merely by accidentally closing them too hard. </NBO>"
                +"Sighing through my nose, I unfolded my fingers. </NBO>"
                +"My right hand was plain, smooth. Perfectly Fae. </NBO>"
                +"I tilted my left hand over, the whorls of dark ink coating my fingers, my wrist, my forearm all the way to the elbow, soaking up the darkness of the room. The eye etched into the center of my palm seemed to watch me, calm and cunning as a cat, its slitted pupil wider than it’d been earlier that day. As if it adjusted to the light, as any ordinary eye would. </NBO>"
                +"I scowled at it. </NBO>"
                +"At whoever might be watching through that tattoo. </NBO>"
                +"I hadn’t heard from Rhys in the three months I’d been here. Not a whisper. I hadn’t dared ask Tamlin, or Lucien, or anyone—lest it’d somehow summon the High Lord of the Night Court, somehow remind him of the fool’s bargain I’d struck Under the Mountain: one week with him every month in exchange for his saving me from the brink of death.</NBO>"
                +"But even if Rhys had miraculously forgotten, I never could. Nor could Tamlin, Lucien, or anyone else. Not with the tattoo. </NBO>"
                +"Even if Rhys, at the end ... even if he hadn’t been exactly an enemy. </NBO>"
                +"To Tamlin, yes. To every other court out there, yes. So few went over the borders of the Night Court and lived to tell. No one really knew what existed in the northernmost part of Prythian.  </NBO>"
                +"Mountains and darkness and stars and death. </NBO>"
                +"But I hadn’t felt like Rhysand’s enemy the last time I’d spoken to him, in the hours after Amarantha’s defeat. I’d told no one about that meeting, what he’d said to me, what I’d confessed to him. </NBO>"
                +"Be glad of your human heart, Feyre. Pity those who don’t feel anything at all. </NBO>"
                +"I  squeezed  my  fingers  into  a  fist,  blocking  out  that  eye,  the  tattoo.  I uncoiled to my feet, and flushed the toilet before padding to the sink to rinse out my mouth, then wash my face.</NBO>"
                +"I wished I felt nothing. </NBO>"
                +"I wished my human heart had been changed with the rest of me, made into immortal marble. Instead of the shredded bit of blackness that it now was, leaking its ichor into me. </NBO>"
                +"Tamlin remained asleep as I crept back into my darkened bedroom, his naked body sprawled across the mattress. For a moment, I just admired the powerful muscles of his back, so lovingly traced by the moonlight, his golden hair, mussed with sleep and the fingers I’d run through it while we made love earlier. </NBO>"
                +"For him, I had done this—for him, I’d gladly wrecked myself and my immortal soul.</NBO>"
                +"And now I had eternity to live with it. </NBO>"
                +"I continued to the bed, each step heavier, harder. The sheets were now cool and dry, and I slipped in, curling my back to him, wrapping my arms around myself. His breathing was deep—even. But with my Fae ears ... sometimes I wondered if I heard his breath catch, only for a heartbeat. I never had the nerve to ask if he was awake.  </NBO>"
                +"He never woke when the nightmares dragged me from sleep; never woke when I vomited my guts up night after night. If he knew or heard, he said nothing about it. </NBO>"
                +"I knew similar dreams chased him from his slumber as often as I fled from mine. The first time it had happened, I’d awoken—tried to speak to him. But he’d shaken off my touch, his skin clammy, and had shifted into that beast of fur and claws and horns and fangs. He’d spent the rest of the night sprawled across the foot of the bed, monitoring the door, the wall of windows. </NBO>"
                +"He’d since spent many nights like that. </NBO>"
                +"Curled in the bed, I pulled the blanket higher, craving its warmth against the chill night. It had become our unspoken agreement—not to let Amarantha win by acknowledging that she still tormented us in our dreams and waking hours.</NBO>"
                +"It was easier to not have to explain, anyway. To not have to tell him that though I’d freed him, saved his people and all of Prythian from Amarantha ... I’d broken myself apart. </NBO>"

        title: "City of Bones",
        synopsis: "When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder—much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It’s hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing—not even a smear of blood—to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?</NBO> This is Clary’s first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It’s also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace’s world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know... </NBO> Exotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare’s ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end.

        title: "The Hunger Games",
        synopsis: "Winning means fame and fortune. Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun. . . . In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. ",

Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.",

        synopsis: "What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?</NBO> When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius―his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse. </NBO> Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through? Casey McQuiston's Red, White & Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.",

She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.</NBO> Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.</NBO> As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</NBO>",
